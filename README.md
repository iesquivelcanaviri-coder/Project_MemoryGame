## Purpose
This version focuses on:
- Extremely detailed beginner-friendly comments
- Deep understanding of JavaScript logic and data flow
- Clear explanation of DOM interaction
- Demonstrating learning progression for assessment

---

## Features
- Memory card matching game
- Player name validation (required input)
- Difficulty selection (easy / medium / hard)
- Move counter (1 move per pair of flips)
- Timer (starts on game start and stops on completion)
- Dynamic board rendering using JavaScript
- Restart button (restarts using current difficulty)

---

## Learning Focus
- DOM element references (`getElementById`)
- Event listeners (`submit`, `click`)
- Arrays and objects (deck + game state)
- Game state management (`state` object)
- Conditional logic (match vs mismatch)
- Input locking (`lockBoard`) to prevent rapid clicking
- CSS Grid layout for dynamic board sizes
